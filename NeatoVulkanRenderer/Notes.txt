Descriptors:
	"An opaque representation that stores 'one bind'".
	Could be an image, sampler, uniform... etc.

	Think of Descriptors as items sent to the army oversees.
	A set is a crate with multiple items in it
	A descriptor set layout is the manifest of cargo.
	The army is the graphics pipeline you've set up.

Descriptor Set:
	Descriptors aren't bound individually, but in a block.

Descriptor Set Layout
	"The easiest way to think about this is consider VkDescriptorSetLayout as 
	being like a C struct type - it describes some members, each member having 
	an opaque type (constant buffer, load/store image, etc). 
	The VkDescriptorSet is a specific instance of that type - and each 
	member in the VkDescriptorSet is a binding you can 
	update with whichever resource you want it to contain."
